Zed Powercell Checkpoint randomizer 0.0.01

This is a very early proof of concept that will be changed later but have fun with it for now!!

Installation instructions:
1: Extract `goal_src_cell_randomizer_0.0.01.rar` and replace the `goal_src` folder in your openGoal installation.
2: Open gk.exe and play!

If you would like to change the frequency of when jak warps you can find that value/setting at the top of `collectables.gc`

While this is one of the first goal_src mods of its kind released so far, I would like to take a moment to the rar password is "I read the disclaimer" remind everyone that downloading and executing arbitrary code is at **YOUR** own risk and to only use code from known trusted sources (be aware that others may pretend to be a trusted source to trick you into downloading malicious code.

**IF AFTER REPLACING GOAL_SRC THE GAME CRASHES IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE OPENGOAL DEVELOPERS OR AN ISSUE FOR THE PROJECT/GITHUB THIS IS INDEPENDENT CONTACT ZED NOT THE DEVS**
